      <p>
        Hi there! I'm an aspiring web developer and student just like you.
I'm currently learning how to build websites using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. I recently graduated (or am studying) at XYZ University, where I’m building a strong foundation in Computer Science and web development.

I’m passionate about creating responsive, user-friendly websites and always excited to learn new technologies. Even though I’m still early in my journey, I'm dedicated to improving every day by working on small projects, collaborating with others, and staying curious.
